## Refactoring Exercise

### Goal
Here's some really bad code!  It is (intentionally) bad, with lots of
duplicated/copied and pasted code, improper use of method/classes, bad naming
of variables and methods, etc.

Feel free to create new classes, helper methods, etc as you see fit.  
Feel free to split things into new files and folders as you like, but
keeping everything in one file is fine too.

You have 45 minutes to complete this exercise.  You are not expected to have
enough time to make all of the changes you would like.  Part of the exercise
is the time constraint: you have to prioritize what you think will be the most
beneficial refactor, and weigh it with how much time it will take you.
